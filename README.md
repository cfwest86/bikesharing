## Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis was to help determine demographic as well as other general characteristics of Citi Bike users in NYC during the month of August, in anticipation of beginning a similar bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. By analyzing publicly available data from Citi Bike, our team hopes to better position our initial offerings in Des Moines so as to stand the best chance of a successful launch. Factors specifically looked at included; Gender and customer type, Trip duration by gender, trip frequency by gender and user type, and trip frequency by weekday and specific hours of each day. 

## Results 

### Figure A.

Here we can see that for the month of August, men and Citi Bike Subscribers made up the majority of Citi Bike users in NYC. 


### Figure B.

As evident in Figure B, almost all rides measured had a duration of less than 1 hour, with the vast majority of those lasting less than 30 minutes. This was true for all genders. 


### Figure C.

Here we have drilled down further into trip frequency, and can tell the vast majority of rides occur during weekdays by male subscribers, with Thursday and Friday being the busiest days. 


### Figure D.

Going even deeper into specific hours of day, we can see in the graph above that the peak hours for use occur on weekdays from 7-9am and 4 to 7pm, whereas weekend usage is fairly constant from 9am through 7pm. When broken down by gender, these trends largely hold steady, although it is interesting to note it seems men are slightly more likely to bike over the weekend, and on Fridays on or after 1pm. 


## Summary 

From this limited analysis, it seems the majority of Citi Bike users in NYC in the month of August were male subscribers taking short trips to or from work, or spending the weekend biking short distances through the city throughout daylight hours.  For future research, it would likely be beneficial to look at visualizations of trip duration vs days/hours of the week, to see if the length of rides increased from weekdays vs. weekends. In addition, it would be beneficial to look at bike usage for months where the weather was reflective of what could be expected in Des Moines, Iowa. We would need to of course pull in monthly averages of weather data for each city before hand. Further analysis should also focus on ensuring the characteristics of Des Moine such as but not limited to weather, gender breakdown, and distances between major points of interest, were similar enough between cities to further ensure our analysis is applicable to entry into this new market.
